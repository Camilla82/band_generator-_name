This repository is part of my "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" by Angela Yu.

In day 1, we were asked to create a band name generator that combines the city you grew up in and your pet's name. 

What we learned with this example: 

- Print function
- Assigning a value to a variable
- \n command
- Input function
- String concatenation
